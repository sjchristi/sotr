== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is the simplest syntax for the [nivo] shortcode? = 
If you simply want to show all the attached images to a page, post or custom post type then use
`[nivo]`

= I typed [nivo] and got [nivo] back =
You need to activate both the oik-nivo-slider plugin and the oik base plugin. The [nivo] shortcode only becomes functional when [oik] is loaded.

= My images do not appear in the slider =
The most common fixes to this problem are:

* Don't insert the images that you want in the slideshow into the page; just upload media and save changes.
* The slider requires jQuery. Check that your theme files contain calls to wp_head() and wp_footer().


= What are the parameters to the [nivo] shortcode? =
The basic parameters that control the display of the Nivo slider are:

`[nivo
  theme="default|bar|dark|light|oik|orman|pascal|default271|oik271 - Theme for the slideshow"
  link="y|n - Link the images to the target post/page"
  caption="y|n - Display the image title as the caption"
  ribbon="y|n - Display the ribbon, if the theme supports it (version 271 only)"
  thumbnail="full|thumbnail|medium|large|nnn|wxh - image size"
  class="|classes - CSS classes"
  thumbs="|n|y - thumbnail navigation"
  effect="random|sliceDownRight|sliceDownLeft|sliceUpRight|sliceUpLeft|sliceUpDown|sliceUpDownLeft|fold|fade|boxRandom|boxRain|boxRainReverse|boxRainGrow|boxRainGrowReverse|slideInLeft|slideInRight
]`

= How do I make the images link to my content? = 
There are two methods.

If your slide show is created from attached images then use the oik custom image link URL field in the Add Media dialog to set the target for the link.

Alternatively build the slideshow dynamically from images attached to related content. 

Use the post_type parameter to specify the content type and
 
* either the post_parent parameter for hierarchical content types 
* or category for posts 
* or other selection criteria for other content types


`[nivo
  post_type="post_type - Post type to display"
  post_parent="|ID - Parent ID to use if not current post"
]`


= What is the FULL syntax for the [nivo] shortcode = 
`[nivo
  post_type="attachment|post_type|special:value - Post type to display"
  theme="default|bar|dark|light|oik|orman|pascal|default271|oik271 - Theme for the slideshow"
  class="|classes - CSS classes"
  link="y|n - Link the images to the target post/page"
  caption="y|n - Display the image title as the caption"
  ribbon="y|n - Display the ribbon, if the theme supports it"
  thumbnail="full|thumbnail|medium|large|nnn|wxh - image size"
  thumbs="|n|y - thumbnail navigation"
  effect="random|sliceDownRight|sliceDownLeft|sliceUpRight|sliceUpLeft|sliceUpDown|sliceUpDownLeft|fold|fade|boxRandom|boxRain|boxRainReverse|boxRainGrow|boxRainGrowReverse|slideInLeft|slideInRight - transition effect"
  numberposts="5|numeric - number to return"
  offset="0|numeric - offset from which to start"
  category="|category-id - category IDs (comma separated)"
  category_name="|category-slug - category slugs (comma separated)"
  customcategoryname="|category-slug - custom category slug"
  orderby="date|ID|title|parent|rand|menu_order - Sort sequence"
  order="DESC|ASC - Sort order."
  include="|id1,id2 - IDs to include"
  exclude="|id1,id2 - IDs to exclude"
  meta_key="|meta key - post metadata key"
  meta_value="|meta value - post metadata value"
  post_mime_type="|image|application|text|video|mime type - Attached media MIME type"
  post_parent="|ID - Parent ID to use if not current post"
  post_status="publish|pending|draft|auto-draft|future|private|trash|any - Post status"
]`

= Do I have to remember all those parameters? =
NO. You can enable the oik TinyMCE shortcode or quicktag buttons. See oik options > Buttons.
When editing a post/page with TinyMCE or the HTML editor click on the shortcode button to see a list of ALL enabled shortcodes and get syntax help, where available.

= What's OIK and why do I need it? = 
The oik Nivo slider is developed using the OIK (Often Included Key Information) API (Application Programming Interface).
If you don't have the OIK plugin installed and activated then the Nivo slider shortcode won't work.

Specifically, the code is dependent upon bw_get_posts() to obtain the list of attachments, posts, pages or custom post types
which populate the slider and bw_thumbnail() to select the image to display when it's not an attached image. 

= I can't see some of the images in my slideshow =
The default image size is thumbnail=full.
At present the bw_thumbnail() function will only return an image for a particular post id
when there is an attached image; it won't find the featured image. As a workaround either specify the thumbnail parameter as small,medium,large or your preferred size (e.g. 150x100)
OR ensure that the image you want to display is attached to the post
OR exclude the post from the list ( exclude=id1,id2 )

= Do I need to make my images the same size? =
NO, not any more. 
If you use any one of the five themes associated with jQuery Nivo version 3.1 then the images can be different sizes.
Warning: you might not like the results though.

= Can I control the slideshow transitions? =
YES. Use the Nivo slider settings page.

= Can I provide my own themeing? =
This is planned for a future version.

= Can I put the [nivo] shortcode in my sidebar? =
YES. You can use the [nivo] shortcode in sidebars, headers and footers by using a text widget.
It's just like entering the shortcode into a post, page or custom post type.
Remember you may need to set the post_parent parameter to control which posts are loaded.

= Can I code the shortcode into header.php? =
Not directly. In order to get the shortcode to expand you need to wrap it in some php.
One way of achieving this is to code
`<?php echo do_shortcode('[nivo post_type=attachment post_parent=487 caption=n]'); ?>`

= Which version of the jQuery Nivo slider code is needed? =
The plugin includes TWO versions of the FREE jQuery Nivo slider from Dev7 Studios
* Version 3.1 is the latest version producing responsive slideshows.
* oik-nivo-slider continues to support the themes for version 2.7.1: default271, orman, pascal and oik271
 
= Does it support version 3.1 of the jQuery Nivo slider? =
YES... from oik-nivo-slider version 1.7

= Does it support thumbnail navigation? =
YES... from oik-nivo-slider version 1.7 with oik 1.17 or higher
Thumbnail navigation is supported for version 3.1 of the nivo jQuery code.

= Can I choose the effect per slider? =
YES... Use the effect= parameter e.g. [nivo effect=boxRain]

= Which version of jQuery does it use? =
It uses the jQuery library provided by WordPress. In WordPress 3.3.1 it was 1.7.1. For WordPress 3.4.1/3.4.2 it is 1.7.2

= What's the difference between this plugin and Nivo's WordPress plugin =
I have not tried Nivo's plugin. But you can read about it and watch a video here
http://nivo.dev7studios.com/features/#wordpress

= Does it support NextGEN galleries? =
YES. Basic support for images in NextGEN galleries has been added in version 1.18
You need to use a special post_type parameter 
e.g. 
[nivo post_type=nggallery:1]

* The special post_type is nggallery
* Then you need a colon (:)
* Then the ID of the gallery

= What other special post types are there? =
oik-nivo-slider has built in support for:

* nggallery:id - display the images from a NextGEN gallery 
* screenshot:plugin_name - display the screenshots for an installed plugin

= Can you tell me more? =
YES. See [oik-nivo-slider](http://www.oik-plugins.com/oik-plugins/oik-nivo-slider/)

== Upgrade Notice ==
= 1.8 = 
* Uses latest dependency checking logic. Now dependent upon v1.17 of the oik base plugin

= 1.7.1216 = 
* Download to use the effect= parameter . Only available from oik-plugins.com

= 1.7 = 
* Requires oik v1.17(.1122.1709) for thumbnail navigation support
* Requires oik v1.17.1128 for custom boxCols or boxRows settings

= 1.6 =
* Version 1.6 should be used with oik version 1.16.

= 1.5 =
* Version 1.5 should be used with oik version 1.15. 

= 1.4 =
* Version 1.4 should be used with oik version 1.14, which includes a number of fixes required by oik-nivo-slider

= 1.3 =
* Please upgrade to oik-nivo-slider v1.3 when you upgrade to oik v1.13. A change in oik's bw_jquery() function could have caused slideshow images to be hidden.

= 1.2 = 
* Please upgrade oik to at least version 1.12 before installing oik-nivo-slider v1.2
* The minimum requirement for a WordPress Multisite solution is oik version 1.12.1     

* In order to allow you to change the default slideshow behaviour I needed to add some new functions to oik
* Rather than make the functions pluggable I decided it was better to improve the plugin dependency logic
* So version 1.2 is now dependent upon oik version 1.12
* If you have oik version 1.11 or earlier then the plugin will activate and issue warning messages
* BUT it will not work!
* If you are installing into a WordPress MultiSite environment oik version 1.2.1 is needed
  
= 1.0 =
* first version works with oik version 1.11
